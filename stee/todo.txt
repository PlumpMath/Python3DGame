* Stop sea model from coming through terrain models:

  Instead of placing one sea model under the terrain models, put eight around
  them.
  
* Implement path-following steering behaviour with polyline path

* Implement pathfinding algorithm, and occupied/unnocuppied grid representation
  of terrain with trees, buildings, lakes etc. being occupied
  
* Put a blue, textured, transparent plane through the terrain as water for
  lakes. If any vertex of a quad is below the level of this plane then the
  quad is occupied by a lake
  
* Implement non-penetration steering constraint for collision spheres, for
  occupied quads
  
* Add some buildings to the scene

* Add mavasher's birds to the scene

* Fix bug with wander steering hugging obstacles and containers

* Add GUI stuff

* Add objects for the characters to pick up
