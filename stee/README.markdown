# PandaSteer

A plugin-based, reusable implementation of [steering behaviours for
autonomous characters](http://www.red3d.com/cwr/steer/) for the game
engine [Panda3D](http://www.panda3d.org/). Also includes some simple
terrain generation code based on the diamond-square algorithm and Perlin
noise. This code requires Panda3D to be installed on your system. The 3D
models included with the download are from the free set that you
can download from panda3d.org.

# Instructions

Run `pandaSteer.py` for a plugin-based steering behaviours demo.

Run `terrain.py` for a demo of the terrain generator.

Run `scene.py` for a demo 'game' scene combining the terrain generator
and steering behaviours.

The code was originally posted to a [thread on the Panda3D
forums](http://www.panda3d.org/phpbb2/viewtopic.php?t=2431&highlight=).
Thanks to Panda3D forum members ynjh_jo, Thomas_egi, pro-rsoft, drwr,
